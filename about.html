        		<h1>Background</h1>
				<p>I have been a graduate student in the <a href="http://labs.russell.wisc.edu/peery/">Peery lab</a> since 2019. 
        I use a number of methods to examine the effects of rising temperatures and variable precipitation on the individual fitness and 
        demographic rates of California spotted owls. I am also using bioacoustic methods to examine the co-existence of forest owl 
        species in the Sierra Nevada.</p>
        
       <p> I graduated with a B.A. from Colorado College in 2018, where I studied the population ecology of Flammulated owls in Pike National 
        Forest. I completed a <a href = "https://digitalccbeta.coloradocollege.edu/pid/coccc:30024">thesis</a> that examined habitat selection 
	by male Flammulated owls throughout their breeding season, and I kicked off an extensive project to understand the migration patterns 
	of the small owl species. Following graduation, I stayed on with Colorado College's Organismal Biology and Ecology department as a paraprofessional.</p>
